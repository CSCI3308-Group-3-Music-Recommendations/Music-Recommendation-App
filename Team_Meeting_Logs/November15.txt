Minutes for November 30th TA Meeting:

Things we have done (overall):
- set up database
- login and registration page
- made some api routes (loging into spotify, discover (tickemaster), search api, reccomendation)


Questions:
    How are we populating databases?
    - through apis

    Have we set up tables and schemas?
    - yes
    - might have to add a couple more but mostly set up


    What are we stuck on?
    - reccomendation api (call to spotify), you type in something and it will search by relevant text, in index.js but he wants to populate and click on a specific one. So reccomend based on a specific song. Can you call an api from a button? (office hours or during lab)


Tyler:
- worked on: made nav bar, worked on some pages and apis (discover and search)
- next week: finish up reccomendation api

Isabelle:
- worked on: testing, for login and register and maybe one more
- next week: focus on making home page look good, and make profile page (choose image for profile, etc.)


Olivia:
- worked on: registration page, login page, user stories, databases
- next week: finish up user stories (forgot about acceptance criteria), continue working on login/registration, testing


Ali:
- worked on: header/nav bar, footer, and profile page
- next week: work on ui for pages, make pages in nav bar link to actual pages, work on having photos/icons show up

Emanuele:
- work on: spotify api (refres token, access token, etc.) so users can sync account with spotify
- next week: test routes, route to get top 10 tracks



Things we need to work on:
