Decisions made:
should start working on code and creating the features
Features we want to include:
- use Spotify's API to link to Spotify
- have a database of songs (using Genius API) so that users can filter through songs and their attributes
- use Ticketmaster API to recommend nearby events (around 10) based on recent artists
- profile page with info about user (top artists and genres) and most recent searches
- will store user info, including username and hashed password, recent searches, and if connected to Spotify, favorite artists and/or genres

Alternative actions/options discussed:

Roles and Responsibilities:
Emanuele: will continue brainstorming the app and has created use case stories
Tyler: will work on the pages and the database mostly
Olivia: Document from the lab, will work on the profile page and setting up the pages
Ali: Will work on use case scenarios and setting up the web pages
Isabelle: will set up partials for the pages

Follow-up items:
- need to add calendar events for the following TA meetings
- need to add descriptions to the user stories, as well as assignees for each one
