# BeatBuddy Description
BeatBuddy is the ultimate app for every music lover, as it allows you to see your top tracks/artists in multiple time periods. It also allows you to get song recommendations so you will never run out of new music to listen to. And you will never miss your favorite artist coming into town as our discover page allows you to search for specific events in your city and to fill the page with events from your top artists.

# Technology Stack
Github for project tracking and VCS repository; HTML, CSS, and EJS for UI tools; Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Last.fm for APIs; VSCode for our ide; PostgresSQL for database, NodeJs for application server, and Microsoft Azure for a virtual machine deployment.

# Prerequisites
You will need a code editor (such as VSCode) and Docker to be able to run the site. Also, you will need a Spotify account to access all of the website's features, and you will need to know your credentials so you can log into it.

# How to run the application locally
Make sure you have docker open and run "docker-compose up" and then go to http://localhost:3000/. Once you are done, run "docker-compose down" or "docker-compose down -v" if you would like to remove users you have registered from the database. To be able to connect to Spotify, your email must be added to the Spotify Developer Dashboard. To do this, send your email to: emri4201@colorado.edu.

# How to run the tests
To run the tests, switch to the testing branch and run "docker-compose up". Once finished, run "docker-compose down".
